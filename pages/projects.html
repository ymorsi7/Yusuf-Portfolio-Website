 <h5 id = "drow"> Arduino, Python, OpenCV: Swaying Attention: Drowsiness Detection (Winter 2021) </h5>
    <p>For our final project in ECE 16 (Rapid Software and Hardware Design) at UCSD, my partner and I used some of the skills we
      learning throughout the quarter to create a design that we had in mind. Swaying Attention is a project that aims to tackle the problem of students not paying attention. Students not paying attention in class was a problem when school is in person but now that most students are doing school online as a result of quarantine the problem has gotten a lot worse. Many students, including ourselves, have a hard time paying attention in online lectures and end up missing a
        major portion of the content. To solve this problem we created Swaying attention, a program that
        uses eye detection to track students dozing off and gives them a reminder to stay focused. To
        achieve this we used Python, OpenCV, D-lib, Arduino-C code and a Sparkfun ESP32 board. Our
        prototype is able to detect drowsiness and outputs a message to the student on a display as well as
        making noise with a buzzer to get their attention.</p>

 <h5 id = "dp">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python: Dear Pressure (Fall 2020) </h5>
    <p> As a member of UCSD's IEEE branch, myself and four other engineering students worked on a quarterly project together. We created a website that fit this quarter's theme: health. Our site, Dear Pressure, includes a Python workout recommender that tells people which workouts they should do based on their inputs. Other features include a fitness news section, an embedded calendar, and an about section. Below, you can find our project documentation and a video demonstration of the website. </p>

 <h5 id = "ultsens"> Arduino, Eagle, Onshape, and Fritzing: Non-Contact Range Detection of Ultrasonic Sensor (Fall 2020) </h5>
    <p>While taking ECE 5 (Introduction to Electrical Engineering) at UCSD, myself and two other people formed a group to create a lab assignment. For this lab, the student is meant to work with a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to write Arduino-C code that will print this general distance the pulse travelled upon meeting an obstacle. In addition, they need to graph it onto Arduino IDE’s serial monitor and continue to build upon the HC-SR04 by integrating three LEDs and a buzzer to signify danger zones. An IR Remote and Receiver were also added as additional components to pause the HC-SR04 sensor. If the danger zone is activated, it can be detected whether the obstacle is an object or a human being through a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor. This will all compose into our final design: the Ultrasonic Sensor Security System. </p>

 <h5> MATLAB and Arduino: Signal Processing (Fall 2020) </h5>
    <p> The objective of this project was not only to give us a better understanding of MATLAB, but also familiarize us with digital signal processing. It was meant to
        teach us how to digitize signals with MATLAB and Arduino. In addition, we
        learned how to both create and analyze Power Spectrum plots. Below are examples of a few of the many plots that I created.</p>
